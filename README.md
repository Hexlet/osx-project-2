The Problem and The Target Auditory
===================================
This app works as a typical metronome and is intended to be used by anyone who requires a metronome - so any musician. It would be redundant to stress the importance of using metronome while playing exercises, rehearsing etc. Also metronome can provide necessary "clicktrack" while performing - be it live or during studio sessions - when provided to the player via headphones.

The Solution
============
The app provides all necessary features that are expected to be present in modern days metronomes:
- Tempo can be specified either in BPM, or using a selection of classic tempos from Larghissimo to Prestissimo;
- A wide selection of time signatures is provided to allow accentuation of "strong" beat;
- User can also choose whether metronome should sound on quarter, eights of sixteenth notes.
