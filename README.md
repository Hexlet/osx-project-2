POMODORO
========

The [Pomodoro technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) 
([по-русски](http://personaleffect.ru/the-pomodoro-technique/)) is a time management method.
The technique uses a timer to break down periods of work into 25-minute intervals called 'Pomodoros' (from the Italian word for 'tomato') separated by breaks.
The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.
There are five basic steps to implementing the technique:

* decide on the task to be done
* set the pomodoro (timer) to 25 minutes
* work on the task until the timer rings; record with an x
* take a short break (3-5 minutes)
* every four "pomodoros" take a longer break (15–30 minutes)

Usage example & Workflow
--------

As a user of this program:

1. I enter the task name in the text field and press the button (or Enter/Return) to confirm
2. I set an interval (range 1-25 minutes) by moving the slider
3. I work on my task during the interval (without any breaks) and if I'm interrupted I press the reset button to start the interval once again from the beginning
4. There is a countdouwn that shows remaining time of the interval
5. When the countdown becomes zero the app plays bell/ring sound to notify me
6. Then I can mark the task as done or take another interval
7. Completed tasks are shown in the "Task History" area
