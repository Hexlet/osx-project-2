Simple Universal Shop
The idea behind this project is creating universal, flexible Internet shop and actually consists of two
applications :
? The Administrative version (the shop owner) and
? The Client module (buyers).
By using administrative stand along application you can place merchandise on the interactive shelfs along
with all relevant information related to the particular item and general information such as contact
information and address, you can add/remove categories, take photo using your device camera or existing
photo-library, sending push notification is also available in this version .
All data is kept on the Dropbox account of the shop owner .
By using the client (customer) application you are entitled to browse the shared information and leave your
feedback reviews on specific items .
P.S.
Please, ignore the code totally, it comes to illustrate the general layout pattern only.
